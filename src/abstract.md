  The `cowkit` toolkit allows writers to **focus on writing**, and comes with a fair amount of (optional) **academic writing features**, such automatic numbering
  of sections, tables, figures, equations, etc, This tool mainly aims to enable inter-connected content structures from a collection of standalone
  markdown files, *without* having to depend on opinionated frameworks.
