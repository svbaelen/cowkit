abstract: |
  This is an example document that was built with [cowkit](https://github.com/svbaelen/cowkit). Check out the project if you want to start writing
  with this tool. The concept is simple: <b>write in markdown</b>, include plain HTML wherever you want, or plugin `LaTeX` snippets if you need to.
  The `cowkit` program allows for <b>generating HTML, LaTeX, and PDF</b> outputs. The LaTeX output is an intermediate step if you want to finetune the `.tex`
  doc before publishing.
