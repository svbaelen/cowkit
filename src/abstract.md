  The `cowkit` toolkit translates standalone markdown files into coherent LaTeX, HTML, and PDF. The tool allows authors to **focus on writing**, and
  comes with a fair amount of (optional) **academic writing features**, such automatic numbering of sections, tables, figures, equations, etc, This
  tool mainly aims to produce clear, inter-connected content using standardized input and output formats, *without* having to depend on opinionated
  frameworks. HTML and LaTeX templates can be **easily customized** to _your_ needs and personal taste. Enjoy!
