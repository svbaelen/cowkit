  This online document is the *default example* built with [cowkit](https://github.com/svbaelen/cowkit), that is, the result of [`cowkit
  --init -s`](https://github.com/svbaelen/cowkit?tab=readme-ov-file#get-started). Check out the project if you want to start writing
  with this tool. The concept is simple: <b>write in markdown</b>, include plain HTML wherever you want, or plugin `LaTeX` snippets if you need to.
  The `cowkit` program allows for <b>generating HTML, LaTeX, and PDF</b> outputs which you can still finetune afterwards, if desired. It comes with
  some pre-defined styles and templates, however, feel free to write and plug in yours. Check out [some
  examples](https://github.com/svbaelen/cowkit/blob/main/examples/examples_cli.md).

  The `cowkit` utility integrates the necessary ingredients for **academic writing** such as articles or a thesis, but can also be used to write
  **non-adacemic books, blog posts**, or **software documentation**, just to name a few. By writing in Markdown (and/or HTML), you get rendering
  of your clutter-free(ish) content right out of the box in almost all development platforms such as [Github](https://github.com/) and
  [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/), without a single build procedure.
